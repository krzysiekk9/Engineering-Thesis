## Engineering-Thesis

This site was made for controlling lighting in a smart building. 

The site was created while doing my engineering thrsis on the subject of "Microprocessor Lighting Control System in an Intelligent Building".

Site has user friendly iterface, where user can choose which lamp they want to turn on or off. 
Site is always telling current state of each lamp.
