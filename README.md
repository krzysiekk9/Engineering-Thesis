## Engineering-Thesis

This site was made for controlling lighting in a smart building. 

The site was created while doing my engineering thrsis on the subject of "Microprocessor Lighting Control System in an Intelligent Building".

---

Site has user friendly iterface, where user can choose which lamp they want to turn on or off. 
Site is always telling current state of each lamp. It is written in a bit outdated JS version, because I wrote it at the begining of learning JavaScript.

### How does it work?

The site is communicating with a database which is firebase. For there it gets necessary information and displays for user. The lightning system comunicates with firebse via microcontroller ESP8266, gets information that it needs and updates the current state of each lamp.
